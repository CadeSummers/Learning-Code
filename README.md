# Learning-Code

The contents of this repository are some, but not all, of the collective works, problem sets, and lessons I had worked on in learning to Code. What lays herein is not my best work at times, but it is the process of my learning documented for all to see. This includes problem sets from the textbook _The C Programming Language_ by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, problem sets by from the _Harvard CS50_ course and others. 

The process of learning to code has been one of the greatest decisions I have made, and the process is a continous one. This is some of my earliest work in coding and software development, and at many times is clearly novice, nonetheless I am proud of it and wish to hang it here.
